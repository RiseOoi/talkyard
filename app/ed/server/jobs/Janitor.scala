/** Runs various background tasks:

  * - Deletes old data, e.g. uploads no longer in use, and ip addresses and other
  * a bit personal data from the audit log.
  *
  * - Carries out review decisions [5YMBWQT] â€” they're delayed maybe 10 seconds,
  * so the staff can click Undo, if they accidentally clicked the wrong button. [REVIEWUNDO]
  *
  * These things are done by a single actor / background thread, to reduce the risk
  * for database serialization problems (if different threads happen to update the same
  * parts of the database, in a fine & okay way, but that happen to cause serialization
  * errors and rollbacks. This is not the same thing as database deadlocks = bugs (usually).)
